The config below may be used to push cpu hasrate:

"mode":"Fast",
"1gb-pages": True,
"huge-pages":true,
"astrobwt-max-size":550-800,>>"suggest u play in between this number"
"algo":"RandomX"
"nicehash":true,

Note if mining fails it means your cpu processor doesnot have high capabilty mining set to default . And i suggest you to rerun a few time as the miner will change certain codes such as ip address.

Current default mining wallet address belongs to me feel free to mine on my wallet address or donate some as a contribution.
